# Music Mixer 🎵
The MMED-1055 Music Mixer is a one-page application for creating different music compositions. The mixer's theme is classical music, with piano, violin, and orchestra options for different music loops. The mixer uses the drag-and-drop function below each instrument to create the composition. There is also an AMP that controls the volume, play, and pause functions of the music mixer. Enjoy!
